robots.txt is an extremely simply format, but it still needs some parser loving. This class will normalise robots.txt entries for you.

USAGE
-----

With the following robots.txt:

User-agent: *
Disallow: /logs

User-agent: Google
Disallow: /admin

Use it like this:

require 'robotstxtparser'

# Also accepts a local file
rp = RobotsTxtParser.new()
rp.read("http://something.com/robots.txt")

rp.user_agents('Google') # returns ["/logs", "/admin"]
